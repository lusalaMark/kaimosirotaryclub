            This policy is intended to establish guidelines and procedures for
            the effective and consistent administration of Rotary Club of

          <h1>FUNDING INTERESTS:</h1>
          <p>
            Rotary Club of Ladner prefers to award donations that have a
            humanitarian or educational focus. Preference is given to those
            programs and services that benefit many people as opposed to a
            single beneficiary. The priority of the Rotary Club of Ladner is to
            support projects in partnership with The Rotary Foundation and with
            other Rotary clubs. Rotary Club of Ladner prefers to award donations
            for “capital “projects, (i.e. equipment, furnishings, computer
            supplies, etc.) vs. operational funding. Funding for wages will not
            generally be considered. Donations may be awarded for one‐time
            programs or new and innovative services
