            Since the first meeting, we have tried. I would rank us highly for
            the achievements we have attained, and above all, staying above
            board. Like most start-ups, we are also prone to similar challenges
            like scepticism, optimism, and declining participation in meetings.
            Nevertheless, we can attest to the prevailing commitment and focus.
