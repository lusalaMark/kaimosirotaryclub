            Club administration committee will understand oversee
            responsibilities related to increasing club effectiveness. The role
            of the club administration committee is to conduct activities
            associated with the effective operation of the club. It is only
            through efficient club operations that a Rotary club can provide
            service to its community, retain members, and develop leaders for
            the club, district, and Rotary International.

            The value of a variable can be changed. So, for example, if you were
            to write a tax calculator that allowed the user to enter a subtotal
            and then calculated both the tax and also the grand total (that is,
            the subtotal plus the tax), you might declare three floating point
            (double) variables named subtotal, tax and grandtotal.
